# Repository for the publication "Diatoms reduce decomposition of and fungal abundance on less recalcitrant leaf litter via negative priming"
This repository contains the data for the related manuscript published in Microbial Ecology

# Description and details of material
*.csv: *Several data tables with raw data*

*Data decomposition*: Mass loss data in percent, separated by leaf spieces, microbial treatment, and light condition

*Data bacteria_AUC*: Bacterial abundance as number of bacterial operon copies (*10<sup>8</sup>) per mg leaf dry weight, integrated over the 30-d study period as well as separated by leaf species, microbial treatment, and light condition

*Data fungi_SYBR_AUC*: Fungal abundance as number of fungal operon copies (*10<sup>8</sup>) per mg leaf dry weight, integrated over the 30-d study period as well as separated by leaf species, microbial treatment, and light condition. Data were obtained using group-specific SYBR green assays

*Data alder_Taqman*: Relative biomass of individual alder leaf-associated aquatic hyphomycete species, separated microbial treatment, light condition, and sampling date.

*Data beech_Taqman*: Relative biomass of individual beech leaf-associated aquatic hyphomycete species, separated microbial treatment, light condition, and sampling date.
